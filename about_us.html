    <!-- Fedra speaking! Just copy and paste the structure from the other pages,
    you should be able to match it just by copy and pasting the right elements. For reference, that section starts <div class="event-grid-container"> and ends </div>
    For each item within the grid it starts <div class="event-grid-item" and ends also with </div>
    Hope this helps!
  -->

  <div class="event-grid-container"> <!-- This is the grid-->

      <!-- This is the start of each item, keep the same id and class if you want the same style! -->
            <br> <h4> Ever struggled to get tickets to an event you don't want to miss out on? Or watched your friends enjoy the event from your phone screen whilst sitting in your room alone? This is where SainTix comes in - we have designed a page that you can use to find tickets at the best price for all the events you missed out on. Instead of trawling through Facebook in an attempt to find someone who is selling a Christmas Ball ticket, click on the link to take you directly to the person who is selling!
